# Business Problem üë©‚Äçüíª
FLO wants to divide its customers into segments and determine marketing strategies according to these segments. # For this purpose, customers' behaviors will be defined and groups will be created according to these behavioral clusters.


# The Goal of the Project üéØ
1. FLO is adding a new women's shoe brand. The product prices of the included brand are above general customer preferences. For this reason, it is desired to communicate specifically with customers who will be interested in the promotion of the brand and product sales. Customers who are champions or loyal_customers, those who shop over 250 TL on average and from the women's category, will be contacted specifically. The ID of these customers is requested.

2. Nearly 40% discount is planned for Men's and Children's products. It is intended to specifically target customers who are interested in the categories related to this discount, customers who have been good customers in the past but have not been shopping for a long time, those who are asleep and new customers. The IDs of customers who meet these conditions are requested.
